print("In coding's enchanted realm I shall dwell,\nTo bring forth a tale of recursion's spell.\nA magical loop, a dance of code divine,\nLet me unveil its wonders, line by line.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a coding land afar,\nA function emerged, a guiding star.\nWith each call, a journey it did embark,\nUnraveling the mystery in the mists of dark.\n\nPicture a mirror, reflecting its own frame,\nRecursion mirrors itself, a joyous game.\nA function calling itself, it repeats,\nA symphony of echoes, melodies bittersweet.\n\nLike a fractal pattern, blossoms unfurled,\nRecursion explores, into infinite worlds.\nAn enchanting universe lies in each layer,\nAs the function travels, forever and ever.\n\nYet a recursion's tale must be cautious and wary,\nFor it dances on a wire, precarious and scary.\nWithout an exit plan, it could surely fall,\nInto an abyss where endless echoes call.\n\nSo, heed the base case, the anchor that's strong,\nAn escape route to where recursion belongs.\nA condition met, a threshold to find,\nA break from the loop, a release from the bind.\n\nLike a bird longing to nest in its rightful tree,\nRecursive functions crave base cases, you see.\nThey yearn for an end, a goal to enhance,\nTo complete the journey, to find their final stance.\n\nAnd when at last the base case is met,\nRecursion surrenders, its task complete.\nBacktracking gracefully, it unwinds its path,\nRevealing the answers, no longer concealed by math.\n\nSo, embrace the dance of recursion's delight,\nA tapestry woven with code's purest light.\nWith each call, a story from start to end,\nWith base cases as guide, a message to send.\n\nIn this mystical world where code and words meet,\nRecursion sings a saga, an ode so sweet.\nLet it guide you gently through loops unforeseen,\nAnd unlock the beauty that lies in between.")
