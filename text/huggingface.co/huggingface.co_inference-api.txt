How Does It Work?
State of the Art as easy as HTTP requests



huggingface@transformers:~
import requests

def query(payload, model_id, api_token):
	headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"}
	API_URL = f"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/{model_id}"
	response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
	return response.json()

model_id = "distilbert-base-uncased"
api_token = "hf_XXXXXXXX" # get yours at hf.co/settings/tokens
data = query("The goal of life is [MASK].", model_id, api_token)
Fully-hosted API for AI
Up and running in minutes

+50,000 state-of-the-art models
Instantly integrate ML models, deployed for inference via simple API calls.
					

Wide variety of machine learning tasks
We support a broad range of NLP, audio, and vision tasks, including sentiment analysis, text generation,
						speech recognition, object detection and more!
					

Production ready
We have built the most robust, secure and efficient AI infrastructure to handle production level loads with
						unmatched performance and reliability.
					

Real-time inferences
We optimize and accelerate our models to serve predictions up to 10x faster, with the latency required for
						real-time applications.
					

Scalability
The PRO Plan offers higher request rate limits to experiment with models. Need more? Use Inference Endpoints
						for dedicated resources and autoscaling.
					

SLAs
Production level support and 24/7 SLAs are available through our enterprise plans.
					
Why Inference API?


Implement and iterate in no time
Leverage the largest and most diverse library of models for NLP, audio and computer vision to easily build
						machine learning powered applications in minutes.
					


Stay on the cutting edge of AI
Seamlessly upgrade to a new model so you're always up to date with the state of the art.
					


Focus on building
Stop worrying about infrastructure. We take care of models' performance and reliability at scale. Run models
						in milliseconds with just a few lines of code.
					


Let us do the machine learning
Harness the power of AI while staying out of data science and MLOps. The Inference API democratizes machine
						learning to all engineering teams.

Frequently Asked Questions
What’s the latency?We accelerate our models on CPU and GPU so your apps work faster. Read up on
						how we achieved 100x speedup on Transformers.
					
Is my data secure?All data transfers are encrypted in transit with SSL. Hugging Face protects your inference data - no
						third-party access.
						Enterprise plans offer additional layers of security
						for log-less requests.
					
What is your uptime?Check out our
						status page
						to learn more about our uptime and follow status updates on any identified performance issues.
					
Do you offer SLAs?For the free tier, there is no service-level agreement (SLA) on support response times. However,
						enterprise plans include an SLA on support response
						times and uptime guarantees.
					
Does it support large models?Large models (>10gb) require dedicated infrastructure and maintenance to work reliably, we can support this
						via an
						enterprise plan with yearly commitment.
