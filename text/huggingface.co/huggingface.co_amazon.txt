Documentation: Hugging Face in SageMaker



            To train Hugging Face models in Amazon SageMaker, you can use the
            Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) and the Hugging Face
            support in the SageMaker Python SDK.
        

            The DLCs are fully integrated with the SageMaker distributed training
            libraries to train models more quickly using the latest generation of
            accelerated computing instances available on Amazon EC2. With the
            SageMaker Python SDK, you can start training with just a single line of
            code, enabling your teams to move from idea to production more quickly.
        

            To deploy Hugging Face models in Amazon SageMaker, you can use the
            Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers with the new Hugging Face
            Inference Toolkit.
        

            With the new Hugging Face Inference DLCs, deploy your trained models for
            inference with just one more line of code, or select any of the 10,000+
            models publicly available on the ðŸ¤— Hub, and deploy them with Amazon
            SageMaker, to easily create production-ready endpoints that scale
            seamlessly, with built-in monitoring and enterprise-level security.
