Kelly: Oh! Oh! Can I pick the first question?
Jessica: Sure. Go for it!
Kelly: What's the scariest place you've been to!
Jessica: I'll start: Palermo in Italy.
Mickey: And what's so scary about that? Did you break your nail? :P
Jessica: Shut it, Mickey! No, there are the Capuchin Catacombs with 8000 corpses! 
Kelly: Ewwww! Corpses? Rly?
Jessica: Yeah! And you can look at them like museum exhibits. I think they're divided somehow, but have no clue how!
Ollie: That's so cool! Do you get to see the bones or are they covered up?
Jessica: Well, partly. Most of them were exhibited in their clothes. Basically only skulls and hands. 
Mickey: I'm writing this one down! That's so precious!
Ollie: Me too!
The scariest place for Jessica was the Capuchin Catacombs in Palermo.

Carrie: Just back from Fantastic Beast :)
Gina: and what do you think?
Carrie: generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US.
Alex: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews.
Carrie: Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good.
Gina: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied.
Alex: No spoilers, girls.
Carrie: no worries ;)
Carrie: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt?
Gina: I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character
Carrie: not your standard protagonist, that's for sure
Gina: and that's what I liked about him
Alex: Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it.
Carrie: go see it. If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;)
Carrie and Gina saw "Fantastic Beast" and liked it. Ginna loved Eddie Redmayne as Newt.

Nestor: I'm thinking of buying a new laptop
Nestor: And it seems that now is a perfect time for it as Black Friday is coming
Olaf: Hahaha
Nestor: I haven't said anything funny, what's wrong with you
Olaf: Everything's fine with me, you're just being silly
Nestor: Why, cuz I want to save some money buying what I need when it's cheaper?
Nestor: Do you actually know what Blak Friday is about?
Olaf: Of course I know
Olaf: It's a cunningly contrived sales pitch
Olaf: Prices are thought to be reduced but in fact they're the same or even higher...
Nestor: You're just repeating a stupid theory some people made up and try to convince others that it's based on facts
Olaf: You're really naive...
Olaf: <file_other>
Olaf: Click on this link and see for yourself
Olaf: This is one of the sites where people upload photos of the same product and its price 2 weeks before Black Friday and during the promotion
Nestor: And how do I know whether it's a reliable source or not?
Olaf: Carry out your own investigation
Olaf: Go and check prices of the chosen products when the promotion is still on and check them again when the promotion is over
Olaf: Simple
Nestor: What if the laptop I want has been really cheaper and I'll miss a perfect deal?
Olaf: Then I'll help you
Olaf: I know a dude who sells almost new computers at very reasonable prices
Nestor: So ask him to send the offer of what he has in stock to me first
Nestor: If he can offer me a good deal, I'm going to the mall and starting investigation tomorrow
Nestor: Deal?
Olaf: Deal!
Olaf: I'll call or text him and ask to contact you.
Olaf: I'm sure he'll help you and you'll appreciate my advice :-)
Nestor: We'll see about that
Nestor wanted to buy a laptop on Black Friday sales, but Olaf advise against it, as the prices in reality are not reduced. Nestor will check it if Olaf helps him to get a good deal from a guy he knows.

Jesse: Well, have u heard about the Refuge?
Lee: No. What's that?
Melvin: That's the Christmas foundation to help women and children?
Maxine: I think I've heard of them. So what about them?
Jesse: That's right! They help women and children who escape from abuse. And every year they post wish lists of such ppl online and I thought that we could choose one and chip in. 
Melvin: That's a great idea!
Lee: Count me in!
Maxine: Me too.
Jesse: Have a look at these 3 lists: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other>
Lee: I think the second one would be the easiest to arrange.
Maxine: Agree.
Melvin: What about number 3? A bit ambitious, but if we pull together, we'll manage.
Jesse: Actually, I'm in for the 3rd one.
Maxine: I think the 2nd list would be better. The items cos more or less the same and we can easily divide it.
Melvin: But if we agree to chip in the same amount of money, we can deal with the 3rd one easily. 
Lee: Come to think of it, the 3rd one is not that bad. A bit of planning and logistics and were good to go. 
Jesse: So it's settled?
Melvin: Yup.
Lee: Sure. 
Maxine: Fine.
Jesse, Melvin, Lee and Maxine are going to take part in the Christmas charity action of the foundation called Refuge, which helps women and children who escape from abuse.

Kate: I just had a fight with Chris :/
Mary: Oh no, not again
Kate: It's not me who started it. I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose
Mary: What was it this time?
Kate: Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him
Kate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him
Mary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?
Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it
Mary: oh god
Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck
Mary: What did you tell him?
Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.
Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that
Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once
Mary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him
Kate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself
Kate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US
Mary: Oh my god he said that?
Kate: Yes :/
Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much
Kate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him
Mary: No wonder
Kate had a fight with Chris about refugees. He thinks the U.S. should not accept them. Kate and Mary do not share this opinion. They are having second thoughts about their friendship.

Patricia: Why? It's like yesterday she was 5 years old...
Patricia: You know, you have like 15 years of preparation and it shouldn't come as a surprise :) 
Lucy: Pat, as a mother I'm not as good as I always wanted to be...

Patricia: I just don't see things as you do :)
Lucy: :)
Lucy is panicking because her daughter is 15 now and she is not sure she is prepared as a mother.

Mia: But you know what? I would actually like to see it! :D
James: ME TOO, of course! :p Can Amelia go with us?
Mia: To the exhibition or to the exhibition and to the cinema? You remember that we have plans for tomorrow...?
James: both
James: yes, I do
Mia: ok
James: Are you mad at me?
James: Babe, the fact that I suggested that we might go out with Amelia doesn't mean that I don't value time that we spend together, just the two of us.
Mia: I know, I said ok.
James: Are you sure you're fine with this?
Mia: Yup. :)
Mia: I just don't know her very well, it's gonna be stressful for me.
James: :) But you know me, don't you?
Mia: Maybe I do :D
James: Really, there's nothing to worry about. Amelia is quite laid-back and likable. ;)
James: Afterwards we can go to my place and hang out, cuddle and so on... :*
Mia: Sounds good :) :*
James: So we're good, right?
Mia: Right. ;)
James and Mia want to go to an art exhibition tomorrow. James wants Amelia to go with them but Mia isn't sure about it. James and Mia will go to his place afterwards.

Mary: in a week! unbelievable 🎉
Patricia: I can't believe either. 
Patricia: I am also increasingly scared
Mary: you're such an alarmist!
James: But scared of what??
Patricia: the long flight, earth-quakes
Patricia: God, and tsunamis!
James: hahaha, you're really a damn alarmist
James: this is so exaggerated, are you serious?
Patricia: James, I almost never travel, I'm afraid really
James: Listen, nothing will happen. First of all the earthquakes happen rarely, even in Japan and only in certain places
James: it's not like the whole country is shaking all the time
Mary: I'm telling her this all the time, but it's pointless
James: And, most of all, Japanese have amazing architecture because of their experiences with earthquakes. Their cities are super safe
Patricia: What about tsunamis?
James: Are you going to be at the coast even?
Patricia: Mary, are we?
Mary: I doubt. maybe for 2 hours somewhere close to Tokyo
James: So I don't think the next tsunami in Japan will happen exactly at that place and time, relax and enjoy
James: Japan is really an amazing country.
Patricia: Thanks James :)
Mary and Patricia are flying to Japan in a week. Patricia is scared of long flight, earth-quakes and tsunamis. James is comforting her. Mary tried to comfort Patricia too with no effect.

Sage: Good luck haha
Sage is having a beer. Lindsey has just finished her class but is not going to the next one. Just like last week, Lindsey has asked a classmate to fake her signature on the attendance list.

Simon: <file_photo>
Simon: It's funny and scary at the same time.
Simon: BTW it's so annoying that people can't see that such immigration policy reduces safety level for citizens of EU significantly
Charlie: This photo is great. It totally shows what do we all mean when we criticize EU policy. 
Charlie: Berlin has put concrete blocks around Christmas fair, Belgium has soldiers running armed around cities and Paris has mass demonstrations and car arsons happening all over the city.
Charlie: Poland though...
Charlie: One of the last countries unspoilt by uncontrolled migration and terrorism
Charlie: The question is - for how long...
Simon: I always say that there is advantage of the polish situation
Simon: I mean being economically delayed for few decades
Simon: Poland has a chance to develop in fast pace and at the same time has a position to avoid all the mistakes other western powers made.
Simon: The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. 
Charlie: Yup. And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation.
Simon: I admire Poles.
Simon: I admire them for they will to fight.
Simon: They never give up.
Charlie: Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map.
Simon: I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe.
Charlie: Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart.
Simon: Let's hope not.
Charlie: Yup. To conclude: Christmas in Poland will be the best Christmas in Europe :D
Simon: I agree :)
Simon and Charlie admire Poland for its anti-immigration policy and the way it defends its values and interests.

Dick: :)
Frank: If you decide to buy it, I have a contractor that does everything, and he's dirt cheap too!
Dick: Cool, I'll be putting most of my cash in as a down payment, so I won't have much left for renovations.
Frank: How much do you have, 10% or 15%.
Dick: We're putting down 10. We can get quite a good mortgage rate apparently.
Frank: Alright, sounds good. How many apts have you seen already?

Frank: But in total?

Enrique: Thanks for sharing your collection with the class. They loved it!
Farrah: No problem! It was my pleasure!
Enrique: Not everyday you get to see some of those up close and personal like that. We were wowed!
Farrah: Oh, gee, that's so nice!
Enrique: You have a great collection, you should be proud!
Farrah: I am, but not everyone appreciates it.
Enrique: Fossils are a unique thing to collect, that's for sure.
Farrah: If you leave them sitting around, they just become dust magnets!
Enrique: So it's good to share them.
Farrah: Especially with little kids, they get so amazed! It was a fun day.
Enrique: It was for us as well! Will you come back again?
Farrah: Of course! Any time!
Enrique: I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can I give your name and number to that teacher?
Farrah: Sure thing. 
Enrique: I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester.
Farrah: Fair enough. No problem, I understand.
Enrique: Thanks again! It was really interesting!
Farrah: Of course! Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time.
Enrique: That would be great.
Farrah: Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical.
Enrique: Oh, I understand. I'm sure you'll do fine next time with whatever you bring.
Farrah: Thanks! 
Enrique: Our pleasure!
Farrah shared his collection of fossils with the class, and Enrique was very impressed. Enrique would like Farrah to show the collection for the 4th grade students as well.

Chris: I tried jogging today!
Matt: and the key word is "tried"?
Matt: not to mention that you have the weirdest habit to stat the conversation 5 minutes before my work ends :P
Matt: good (or bad) thing is that I need to stay a bit longer today ;)
Chris: Sorry :P
Chris: I have no other friends ;)
Matt: it's not a problem for me, you're the one getting a short conversation ;)
Chris: Anyway, I was certain that I'd just collapse after 50m or so but I did quite well :)
Matt: I would collapse :P
Matt: I'm taking pills that slows my heart rate and that doesn't bode well with any kind of physical effort :P
Matt: my heart doesn't know what to do then :P
Chris: Medication is a different thing.
Chris: I just don't understand how I can run better when I eat 1/3 of what I should...
Matt: power of mind ;)
Matt: and it's your first try in a while
Matt: your body doesn't know what to expect :P
Chris: I need to analyse my performance
Chris: Maybe I can get even better than that!
Matt: back in the days when I was still playing football my first performance after a long break was always spectacular
Matt: I always felt like a physical god
Matt: but the next ones were just horrible and I felt like I was dying :P
Chris: Oh, you killjoy :D
Chris: You're basically saying that I'll crash during my next jog :D
Matt: that's what I'm here for
Matt: a reality check :P
Matt: anyway, done with my work for today, finally can head home!
Matt: cya later
Chris: cya!
Chris started jogging again. He performed better than expected. Matt can't jog now because of his heart medication effects but he recalls that when playing football in the past, he also performed very well after a break.

Jen: I think I'm through with the dickhead. He's being a pain again. I'm going to tell him to move out.
Jane: Did he at least give you back the money he owes you?
Jen: No. He's freeloading and said he has no intention of giving back my money because I don't deserve it with the way I act.
Jane: He has a nerve doesn't he? How dare he?!!!
Jen: I've learnt to hate him with a passion. He's like vermin that you can't cull.
Jen: Abusive, nasty, annoying, irresponsible. He disgusts me.
Jane: Get rid of him! I told you right from the beginning that he's no good.
Jen: Yeah you were absolutely right.. as always.
Jane: I hate to say it but I can smell a fucktard a mile away.
Jen: I seem to pick them, don't I?
Jen: Sometimes I think it is my fault. If only I could be a better person, if only, if only....
Jane: You know that way of thinking will get you nowhere fast. It's self defeating. That's what the abusers want you think that you're bad and you deserve every bit of abuse that they dish out.
Jen: What if he doesn't leave? I'm afraid of asking him to leave 'cause it will only cause another fight.
Jane: You can't spend your whole life walking on eggshells.
Jen: Yeah, you're right... but how do I get out of this mess?
Jane: I think you've got to cut your losses and just move on.
Jen: Easier said than done.
Jane: I know. You've gotta do it Hon. If you don't things will only get worse. Think of how much worse they've already got since you met him.
Jen: Yeah you're right. Sometimes I just don't have the strength. 
Jane: I believe in you. Please do it! Remember I'm always there for you.
Jen is about to break up with her boyfriend. Jane knew from the beginning that they were not a good match. Jane is going to support Jen.

Breonna: Melissa so are you ok with men acting like pigs and grabbing you whenever they feel like it?

Melissa: No one is saying men should behave like animals. Its that kind of thinking that makes men afraid to just be masculine in general though. Not all men are pigs.
Hailey: Thank you! I had a friend get yelled at by a girl for 5 minutes because he held the door for her and said “Ladies first”.

In fact MOST women cant stand them. gtfoh with your pussy hats, your metoo crap, you "screaming" at Potus through your vaginas etc. Dont try to shove your thinking on everyone. how about HIMTOO!!! i LOVE OUR strong REAL MEN!!!! TOO BAD IF ANY OF THOSE CRAZY CAT LADIES DONT LIKE IT

Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;)
Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!
Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog.
Vic: Me neither. 
Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;)
Nancy: I have my reasons ;)
Nancy asks Vic and Phil about various social media, which prompts them to discuss and compare the different platforms. Phil is not into Instagram but likes Twitter. Vic prefers Facebook over Twitter and likes Instagram. Phil and Vic both don't use Tumblr.

Martin: I don't know, it just doesn't feel right...
Nicole: Oh God, just tell me already!! What is it
Nicole: Do you wanna break up? Is there someone else?
Martin: No one! I swear
Nicole: Huh... you didn't say no to the break up part though
Martin: I mean... it's not that I want to but... I guess that depends on you... because there's something you should know
Nicole: What is it... You're making me anxious
Martin: I'm, well... I'm asexual
Martin: I thought you should know because... well... I know it can be a problem in a relationship
Martin: I just wouldn't want you to feel unhappy with me
Martin: It's not like I can't have sex, but it's just not the same for me as for other guys, I guess
Martin: I love you but I want you to be happy, so I thought you should know
Nicole: Well... I'm a little speechless, that's not what I expected, but I don't think it has to be a problem... I don't want to break up like this, let's give it a try first
Martin is asexual. Nicole doesn't want to break up for this reason. She wants to give their relationship a try.
