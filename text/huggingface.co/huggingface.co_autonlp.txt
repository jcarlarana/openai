Customer stories



AutoTrain is the first AutoML tool we have used that can compete with a dedicated ML Engineer. This allows us to spend our time on research and improving data filters/generation, which is game-changing for a small team like ours. The integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem is great, and adds a lot of value even if you host the models yourself.
Sam Havens - Director of NLP Engineering, Writer


Hugging Face's AutoTrain tool chain is a step forward towards Democratizing NLP. It offers non-researchers like me the ability to train highly performant NLP models and get them deployed at scale, quickly and efficiently.
Kumaresan Manickavelu - NLP Product Manager, eBay


AutoTrain has provided us with zero to hero model in minutes with no experience required.
