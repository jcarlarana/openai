Chill out on July 4th with these ice-cream cupcakes. .
Yvonne Ruperti

































Why It Works

A moist red velvet cupcake freezes well.Using less cocoa in the cake allows the red color to come through.Placing the cone on top of the cupcake gives you more cake instead of a mouthful of frosting. (Though frosting lovers are free to skip this step and pipe on more frosting.)Cream cheese frosting freezes well and defrosts without the colors running.The cupcake insulates the ice cream enough to sit for a few minutes at room temperature without the ice cream melting.


Moist buttermilk red velvet cupcakes are filled with the whitest ice cream you can find (such as coconut or vanilla). Rings of white- and blue-tinted cream cheese frosting are piped on top to complete the 4th of July theme. Make these cupcakes ahead of time and serve directly from the freezer for a cool treat.

   Ingredients   


For the Cupcakes:


6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, softened


1 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar


1/2 teaspoon kosher salt


1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil


1 large egg


1 large egg yolk


2/3 cup buttermilk, at room temperature


1 1/2 tablespoons red food coloring


1 1/3 cups (6 2/3 ounces) all-purpose flour


1 teaspoon cocoa powder


1/2 teaspoon baking soda


For the Cream Cheese Frosting:


2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese


6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, softened


1 cup (4 ounces) confectioner's sugar, sifted


Blue food coloring


For the Filling:


1 pint coconut, vanilla, or other white ice cream, slightly softened















Directions





For the Cupcakes: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners. Stir the butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl until creamy. Whisk in the oil, then the egg, egg yolk, buttermilk, and red food coloring until well combined.





Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and baking soda over the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined. Spoon evenly into the prepared muffin tin and bake until the centers are just set, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cupcakes cool in pan for 5 minutes, then remove to cool completely on wire rack.





Set cupcakes on a small tray. Cut a cone shape out of the top center of each cupcake and reserve. Fill center with a scoop of ice cream and smooth the top. Set the cut-out cones on top of the ice cream on each cupcake (see note). Freeze until ice cream is firm, about 30 minutes.





For the Frosting: In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle, beat cream cheese and butter at medium speed until creamy in a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the sugar and beat at medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.





Spoon half of the frosting into a bowl and stir in drops of blue food coloring to desired color. Place each frosting in a bag fitted with a star tip.





Pipe alternate layers of the colored frostings around the cone on top of each cupcake until it is completely covered. Freeze until firm, about 2 hours. If making ahead, place cupcakes in an airtight container and wrap well. Serve straight from freezer (see note).




   Notes  

When assembling the cupcakes, place in freezer at any point if ice cream becomes too soft. Serve cupcakes directly from freezer.


   Special Equipment
