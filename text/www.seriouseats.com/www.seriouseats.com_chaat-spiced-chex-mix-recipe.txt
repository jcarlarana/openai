Why It Works

The chaat masala is a spice blend that adds funky, salty, spicy, and sour flavors to the Chex mix.Adding the chaat masala to the cereal after it has toasted, while it's sticky and warm, keeps the spices from burning.Mix and match cereals, nuts, and crackers to accommodate your tastes.


A favorite gas station snack of mine has always been Chex mix. The erratic combination of cereals and seasonings reminds me of bhel puri chaat, which is what inspired me to make a chaat-spiced version of the classic. I made the mix to my taste, with extra corn and rice Chex, few wheat Chex and pretzels (because who needs 'em?), and an absurd amount of chaat seasoning. I admit, it's probably more seasoning than necessary, but, as someone who's known for digging through a bag of Doritos for that one extra-cheesy chip, I don't see the point of snack foods if they don't leave your blood pressure elevated.












Serious Eats / Vicky Wasik



Chaat masala, the spice mixture used throughout South Asia for the popular street foods known as chaat, combines funky, salty, spicy, and tart flavors, transforming anything it's sprinkled on. Feel free to mix and match your favorite cereals and snacks, using the recipe below as a template. Toasting the cereals low and slow with the butter and sugar mixture gets them extra crisp and sticky, ready for you to shower on the spices.
