The Criteria: What to Look for in a Dinnerware Set




The Best Dinnerware Sets




The Competition (They're Still Fine!)




FAQs




Why We're the Experts









Our favorite dinnerware sets from Dansk is available at a discounted price right now.



Straight to the Point

We recommend 13 dinnerware sets and have splurge-worthy and budget-friendly picks. Some of our favorite sets include the Open Kitchen by Williams Sonoma 16-Piece Dinnerware Set and Made In The Tabletop Set, though we have many other picks, too.


It’s a universal truth that dinnerware sets are, for the most part, expensive as heck. They go in the class of things I don’t think should cost as much as they do—along with bath towels, bed sheets, and outdoor furniture. 



But the right dinnerware can elevate any table. Sets come in an endless range of styles—from classic, all-white plates to ones fit for a bistro to ceramics meant to look hand-thrown. Ultimately: no matter the set—and price—dinnerware has to be functional, durable, and (hopefully) eye-appealing. 



This brings me to a point that, as an equipment reviewer who likes to have clearly defined “winners” and “losers,” surprised me. That is: after testing 17 sets priced from $42 to $589 ($2.25 to $33.50 on average per piece), the grand majority of the dinnerware was totally fine. 



There were a couple of sets that our testing panel agreed were eh and some objective factors worth considering (i.e. some of the sets were more prone to scratching). However, you could make a case that most sets could be right for a certain type of consumer/price point/general vibe. 



Ultimately, we landed on 13 winners we thought could be suitable for both everyday use and fancier occasions. However, check out our The Competition section for more options if you don’t find something you like, because, again, most of the sets were good.

   The Tests  










Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



Initial Unboxing Test: Upon unboxing the dinnerware, we evaluated each piece for any glaze imperfections, scratches, or other damage. We also weighed each piece. 
Aesthetics and Feel Test: We had four users evaluate each set, weighing in on its aesthetics, design, feel, and anything else of note. 
Mug Test: We drank hot coffee from each set’s mug (if it had one), evaluating how comfortable the mug was to hold and drink from. 
Durability Test: We took the salad plate from each set and scratched its surface five times with a dinner knife, checking for any damage. We then did this with a steak knife. After inspecting the salad plate, we repeated this scratching-and-checking with the dinner plate from each set. 
Staining Test: We smeared a mixture of turmeric and oil on each dinner plate and left it for three hours (as if you had a dinner party) and didn’t clean up for a prolonged period of time. We then washed each plate, checking for any leftover stains, oil marks, or odors. 
Microwave Test: We put the bowl from each set in the fridge for 30 minutes, filled it with room temperature water, then placed it in the microwave for one-and-a-half minutes, to see if temperature changes would affect the dinnerware, how hot the bowls got in the microwave, and if the dinnerware was truly microwave-safe.
Dishwasher Test: We ran one place setting from each set through the dishwasher, placing them in the dishwasher as non-gently as possible (like you were quickly loading it after dinner). We ran the dishwasher, then unloaded the dishes and checked for any damage. 
Steak Test (Winners-Only): We used a steak knife to slice a 4-ounce portion of steak on the dinner plate from each of our favorite sets. We wanted to see if any juices ran off the sides of the plate or if any scratching occurred from slicing the meat.
Daily Use Test (Winners-Only): We have placed all of our winners into daily use and will update this review with any further findings after a couple of months. 


   What We Learned  
  Consider What You Want in a Dinnerware Set  










We did really like when sets had two bowls: one small and one large.
Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



While all of the sets we tested included dinner and salad plates, the standardization ended there. Some had pasta bowls, some had soup bowls, some had two bowls, some had dessert plates, and some had mugs. We liked it when sets had two bowls (one small, one large), as this felt comprehensive (in my house, we often eat dinner out of behemoth bowls). However, what you want in a dinnerware set is really up to you: maybe a set of mugs is essential or perhaps you already have soup bowls you favor—you get the gist. 



We Tested 12 Flatware Sets to Find the Best Ones for Everyday Use



You should also determine the aesthetic you want. Whether it should be colorful, modern, all-white to match anything, have a bistro vibe, or feel fancier, for example, is totally up to you.



It’s also worth considering how you’ll buy the dinnerware. We favored sets that could be purchased as full sets as well as in additional single-place settings and individual pieces. That way, you could buy a set and add to it over time or easily replace a piece that breaks.


  How Much Should You Spend?   










Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



Ah, a personal question! The *right* price for dinnerware depends entirely on your budget. Our winners run the gamut of price points, so there should be something for everyone. While our testing panel could immediately (and correctly) point out the more expensive sets, our super budget-friendly pick, from AmazonBasics, was still totally serviceable. It’s not exceptional, but its all-white motif will get the job done and is well-suited if you’re furnishing on the cheap, looking for something for a college student, or buying a dinnerware set for a camper or RV. At $2.25 on average per piece, we don’t feel it’s anything to scoff at.


  Wide Rims vs. Straight Walls vs. Gentle Slopes  










A plate with straight walls (left) and one with gently sloped walls (right).
Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



Several of the sets had plates and bowls with wide rims (sometimes paired with more angled sides). While they cut down on the amount of flat plate space, the rims gave you a place to grab onto (especially helpful when pulling a plate or bowl out of a microwave or warming oven). We didn’t mind when they had higher walls either, which kept food nice and centered.



Plates with short, straight walls had more of a modern look (which we liked) and had wide, flat surfaces with plenty of room for food. Because the plates’ usable space was so expansive, the steak tended to slide around more as we cut and ate it.



Lastly, some plates had more gentle slopes to their walls. This was kind of like a middle ground between the wide rim-steep side combo and straight walls: still plenty of flat, usable plate space, but a little more corralling of food.


  Some of the Mug Handles Stunk  










Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



We preferred smaller mugs that help coffee cool faster and allow you to finish a cup before coffee turns cold and sours. We also preferred handles where you could fit at least two fingers through to wrap your hand around the mug. Some of the mugs had small, looped handles that were tougher to hold.



Drinking from the mugs, however, was almost all fine: most had thin enough, unobtrusive lips. 


  How Easily Did the Plates Scratch? How Durable Was the Dinnerware?   










Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



In general, porcelain fared better in our scratching tests—withstanding any marking. The ceramic stoneware tended to scratch more easily. However, most of the marks were super minimal—and we really went at it with a steak knife.



And, for what it’s worth, almost all of the dinnerware emerged from our staining and dishwasher tests spotless.


   The Criteria: What to Look for in a Dinnerware Set  










Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm



We preferred dinnerware sets that were available as a full set and that had additional place settings and/or pieces available for purchase. That way, you can easily add to your collection (or replace something if it breaks). We looked for dinnerware sets that were scratch- and stain-resistant and mugs that were easy to drink from, if the set included one. As for price, we think there’s a ton of great dinnerware out there at a variety of budgets.


   The Best Dinnerware Sets  






A Crowd-Pleasing Dinnerware Set You Can’t Go Wrong With


Williams Sonoma Open Kitchen 16-Piece Dinnerware Set














Williams Sonoma





View On Williams-Sonoma

$130







What we liked: This all-white set really gave us nothing to complain about. Our testing panel said it’s the kind of set that it “doesn't feel like you could go wrong with.” It features dinner and salad plates with wide rims and small bowls suitable for cereal or starter portions of soup. The dinnerware didn’t stain or scratch and the bowl didn’t get hot in the microwave. Its mug was on the small side, which we liked, and had a slightly tapered shape to it and a medium-sized looped handle that we could easily fit our fingers through, allowing us to securely hold it. Pasta bowls can be purchased separately and extra sets of plates, bowls, and mugs are available.



What we didn’t like: The bowl is on the small side. If we’re splitting hairs, there were a few black specks embedded on the surface of a couple of the plates.



Price at time of publish: $120.

The Best Dinnerware Set If You Want It All


Made In The Tabletop Set














Made In





View On Madeincookware.com






What we liked: This porcelain set is made in England and includes our recommended flatware set and serving platter (spoiler alert: our platter review will be out soon). The pieces have beautiful, glossy finishes and colorful rims. The set feels very thoughtfully curated and, despite the higher price tag, you get a lot for your money: dinner plates, appetizer plates, bread and butter plates, side bowls, and very spacious entree bowls (plus the aforementioned silverware and platter). Testers described this set as “pretty classic-looking but with a little flair,” “visually striking,” and “casual and at the same time classic.” It has a lifetime warranty and a “1-year no-chip guarantee.” More sets of plates and bowls (and even a serving bowl) can be purchased separately. 



What we didn’t like: This set is pricey. However, while we tested the “Complete” set that includes a platter and silverware, there are “Essential” and “Starter” sets that are less comprehensive and more inexpensive. The bowl did get fairly hot in the microwave.



Price at time of publish: $599.

A Serious Eats Editor-Favorite Dinnerware Set


Dansk Cafe Blanc Strip Porcelain Dinnerware Rimmed Soup Bowl














Food52





View On Food52

$90







What we liked: Testers said this set reminded them of “way more elegant diner ware.” We liked the heft each piece had to it; it felt very substantial. Its bowls and plates had wide rims that were easy to hold onto and steeper walls that helped to contain food. Its shallow bowl was suitable for pasta or a starter portion of salad. ”I really like the quality; they've stayed shiny and scratch-free even through lots of use and washing,” associate commerce editor Grace Kelly says of this set, which she’s owned for some months. “I also like the timeless aesthetic, which looks good serving just about anything. The small plates are what I mainly use, and they're actually a great size for serving most meals, while I reserve the bigger plates for more formal dinners.”



What we didn’t like: The mug has a thicker, flared lip that some testers didn’t love. It felt like the coffee was more prone to dribble down. Dansk does sell replacement plates and bowls on their website, but they don’t seem to currently be available with the blue stripe motif (just white).

A Dinnerware Set Fit for a Bistro


Williams Sonoma Brasserie Porcelain 16-Piece Dinnerware Set


















View On Williams-Sonoma

$230







What we liked: This substantial-feeling dinnerware still looks refined and elegant, but has an “everyday-ness about it,” a tester said. It has a bistro look, with blue stripes and extra-wide rims. We liked its slim mug which felt comfortable to hold and drink from and had an elegant handle, like a classic teacup. The soup bowls were wider, with flared edges, and would be equally suitable for pasta. There are extra sets of bowls, plates, and mugs available for purchase, as well as matching cereal bowls (though we didn’t test these). 



What we didn’t like: There were little glaze blips on the undersides of the mugs, but these were minor.

A Fun, Modern-Looking Dinnerware Set


Hawkins New York Essential Stoneware Dinnerware














Food52





View On Food52

$12







What we liked: This modern-looking dinnerware had short, straight walls and concentric circles on the surface of its plates. We liked that it came with two bowls, and particularly loved its “pasta bowl,” which was extremely large and could be instead classified as a dinner bowl. This set’s plates didn’t scratch during our tests. Plus, it comes in a range of fun colors (we tested Mustard, though Sky and Olive are also particularly lovely). Additional plates and bowls are available for purchase, as well as mugs and pinch bowls (though we haven’t tested them). 



What we didn’t like: There was a bit of pooled, thicker glaze around the outside edge of one of the bowls and one of the plates had some pooled glaze on the underside edge. One of the salad plates arrived with a couple of scratches on its surface.



Price at time of publish: $184.

A Very Durable Dinnerware Set


Le Creuset San Francisco Coupe 16-Piece Dinnerware Set














Williams Sonoma





View On Williams-Sonoma

$296







What we liked: The Le Creuset dinnerware features three concentric rings on each piece, like the lid of its iconic Dutch oven. The pieces feel substantial, yet lightweight and we liked its slight ombre hue (we tested the Lapis color). “I like that it feels very casual but durable,” a tester said. We also liked this set’s mugs: they were on the small side, easy to hold and drink from, and felt well-suited for morning drip coffee, an afternoon latte, or after-dinner tea. Le Creuset tableware is amazingly durable, too: I’ve owned a set of mugs for years that still look new. When buying a set, you can choose between pasta or cereal bowls, which is a nice customization. Additional plates and bowls are available for purchase.



What we didn’t like: It’s on the pricey side, at $16.25 per piece.



Price at time of publish: $296.

A Slightly Asymmetrical, Beautiful Dinnerware Set


Fable Home Ceramic Dinnerware Set


















View On Fablehome.co






What we liked: We didn’t love most of the intentionally asymmetrical sets (they were too thick and too irregular, which made them harder to stack and move). This one was different: it was just asymmetrical enough to add a little charm, with a slight wave to the edge and a gently rippled surface. We liked that the set came with two bowls and that it's available in some lovely shades (you can mix and match the colors, too). 



What we didn’t like: During our durability test, the plates developed very light scratches.



Price at time of publish: $264.

A Super Budget-Friendly Dinnerware Set

Amazon

$37







What we liked: This all-white dinnerware isn’t the most beautiful, but it gets the job done and comes with plenty of dishes (service for four) for not a lot of money. It’s lightweight and basic and didn’t scratch. “It's great for someone if you're stocking an Airbnb, looking for a camper, etc.,” a tester noted. Its mug was small, had a thin, unobtrusive lip, and was fine to drink coffee from.



What we didn’t like: This set’s bowls were a bit small for our taste.

A Colorful, Eye-Catching Dinnerware Set


Luminarc Arty French Glass Dinnerware














Food52





View On Food52

$42







What we liked: This colorful, somewhat transparent, sodalime glass set is made in France. It reminded us of summer—kind of like a glass version of melamine. The plates and bowls have glossy interiors and matte undersides, which add a little grip. Testers called it “pretty” and thought it felt “fresh.” 



What we didn’t like: While there are replacement plates and bowls available, they’re harder to find (we had to scour Amazon).

A Luxe-Feeling, Beautifully Designed Dinnerware Set


Villeroy & Boch Artesano 4-Piece Place Setting














Bloomingdale





View On Bloomingdales

$69







What we liked: This German-made set is truly beautiful: its bowls and plates feature a flat rim and a creamy, off-white color that feels classic, but still modern. Testers described the aesthetic as “very sweet” and said, “the shapes are beautiful.” We liked its small, tapered mug with a slightly squared-off handle; it felt lovely to hold and drink from. This set didn’t scratch during testing either. The mugs, plates, and bowls are available for sale individually. 



What we didn’t like: We had a hard time finding a set with the same mug and bowl as the ones we tested. Others also called “Artesano” seemed to have different-looking pieces. This means you’d have to buy multiples of this place setting for a full set, but it really is beautiful.

A Dinnerware Set from a Heritage Brand

$200







What we liked: We liked the slightly speckled look of the Staub dinnerware and the stamped “Staub” logo on the top of the plates and sides of the bowls. The bowls are small (ideal for breakfast or a starter portion of soup) and the plates have gently flared edges. There’s a circular indentation on the surface of the plates, which served as a mini juice well when we sliced steak. The dinnerware was fairly lightweight, too. “I like the weight of them though, and I think it's nice it has their name stamped right on them—there's no doubt where they come from,” a tester said.



What we didn’t like: The bowls are fairly small and don’t feel as versatile.

A Dinnerware Set if You Want a Hand-Thrown Feel


Material The Place Setting














Material





View On Materialkitchen.com






What we liked: This dinnerware is unfinished on the underside and has a gently pebbled surface. Testers thought it looked “homey” and like “earthy pottery.” We really liked the size of the bowl: it felt big enough for meals, but not too big for, say, a serving of pasta. The pieces are available individually.



What we didn’t like: The plates developed very light scratches during our durability tests, but they were barely noticeable. When cutting steak, one tester thought that the textured surface made more of a scratching sound. We tested the place setting, as The Full Table was unavailable at the time of this review.

What we liked: I grew up with Fiesta bowls and there’s a chance you’re familiar with them too (it’s highly collected and has a whole fan base). Its vibrant hues and concentric circles are iconic-looking. We liked its wide bowl that had a small, flat rim and felt big enough to be versatile. It’s available in individual place settings as well as a service for four.



What we didn’t like: The small, looped handle on the mug was polarizing during our testing: some testers felt there wasn’t enough to grab onto, while others didn’t mind it.

Serious Eats / Riddley Gemperlein-Schirm


   The Competition (They're Still Fine!)  

Our Table Starter Set: We liked this set: it looks modern and has straight-sided walls. Its bowls were a great size, too. The plates experienced a little more scratching than we would want, though. Its dinnerware has raw, unfinished rims that are meant to aid in stacking, but picked up oil stains during our testing. However, it’s still a beautiful set, if you’re interested in it. 
West Elm Textured Stoneware Dinnerware: We liked the look and multi-textured element of this dinnerware, but one of the salad plates chipped when we gently (and accidentally) knocked it into a dinner plate. 
Crate & Barrel Lina Blue Stripe 16-Piece Place Setting: We liked this set’s expansive dinner plates, but didn’t love the bulbous mug (it was harder to drink from) and asymmetrical-shaped bowl that felt awkward to hold, carry, and stack. 
Crate & Barrel Marin White 4-Piece Place Setting: This set had a steep, v-shaped bowl that felt less versatile. We also thought its mug’s rim was too thick.


   FAQs  
  Where’s the best place to buy dinnerware sets?   

There are plenty of great places to buy dinnerware (like Williams Sonoma and Food52). And all of our favorite dinnerware sets are available for purchase online—some at multiple retailers. 


  What are the most durable dinnerware sets for everyday use?  

We performed several tests to evaluate the durability of the dinnerware sets in our review. For the most part, porcelain sets performed really well and remained scratch- and stain-free. Many of our favorite sets, like the Open Kitchen by Williams Sonoma 16-Piece Dinnerware Set and Dansk Cafe Blanc Stripe Porcelain Dinnerware, are durable and suited for everyday use. 


  What’s a good brand for dinnerware?  

There’s a ton of great dinnerware out there from various brands. Our top picks include sets from Williams Sonoma, Le Creuset, Dansk, Staub, Luminarc, Fiesta, and more.

Great news! All of our favorite dinnerware sets (and all of the ones we tested) are dishwasher-safe. Some dinnerware sets with decorative edges or patterns may not be dishwasher-safe, though (we recommend checking the manufacturer's care instructions to be sure).
