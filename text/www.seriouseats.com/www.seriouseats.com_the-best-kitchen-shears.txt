Why We're the Experts









One of our favorite kitchen shears, the heavy-duty Kershaw Taskmaster Shears, is deeply discounted right now.



Straight to the Point

The best kitchen shears are the Shun Multi-Purpose Kitchen Shears, which are sharp, durable, and comfortable to use. We also really liked the Kershaw Taskmaster Shears as a heavy-duty budget pick.


A great set of kitchen shears has to be able to do a little bit of everything—open packaging, snip herbs, cut flowers, break down a chicken, and still be sharp enough to slide easily through parchment paper. It’s a tight-rope to walk between sharpness and durability, but with smart design (and, say, a built-in bottle opener, screwdriver, and nutcracker tossed in for fun) your next set of kitchen shears could be handy enough to take on a wilderness survival adventure (only slightly kidding). But, since most people will primarily keep shears in the kitchen, we put 12 sets to the test snipping herbs, cutting through parchment paper, and spatchcocking chickens to see which were sharpest, sturdiest, and all-around most useful. 



Editor’s note: We last tested kitchen shears in 2018, but given the number of new shears on the market, we felt it was time for a retest. We included our previous favorites in this review as well, to see how they stacked up.


   The Winners, at a Glance  






The Best Kitchen Shears


Shun Cutlery Multi-Purpose Shears

Our favorite pair from our original review, the Shun shears feature comfortable handles, long blades, and five bonus functions (nutcracker, jar opener, bone notch, bottle opener, and two screwdriver tips), making these shears extra versatile. They were ultra-sharp out of the box and their bone notch helped us spatchcock a chicken quicker and with less effort than any other shears we tested. Lastly, they were easy to take apart to clean, even though the hinge had a snug fit.

These shears had micro-serrations on one side that gripped floppy chives and slippery chicken skin while cutting, and their handles had wide loops that were comfortable to hold. They were also easy to take apart and put back together when cleaning, and are wallet-friendly at $19. 








The Best Heavy-Duty Budget Kitchen Shears


Kershaw Taskmaster Shears

A near clone of our top pick from Shun (and made by the same parent company, Kai), these shears were great at spatchcocking a chicken and performed admirably in sharpness tests. If you’re looking for a budget set of kitchen shears that are durable and can handle heavy-duty jobs, these are a great option. These were a winner in our original review but were briefly discontinued. 


   The Tests  










Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Blade Sharpness Tests: We tested each pair of shears using a professional blade edge tester to measure their sharpness right out of the box, taking measurements from the straight side instead of the serrated side. After the other tests were finished, we tested all the edges again to see if they had dulled after use. Fine Herbs Test: We bundled 10 chives into a tight roll and snipped 2-millimeter sections with each set of shears to see which kitchen shears could make multiple clean cuts the quickest.Parchment Paper Test: We made a single cut, and then slid each set of kitchen shears through the rest of the parchment to test how straight each one cuts, and whether it could slide cleanly through without tearing.Spatchcocking and Thigh Removal Test: We used each shear to cut out the backbone of a chicken and then snipped through the thigh joint to test how easily they went through bone and how cleanly they could cut through the skin. Cleanup and Durability Tests: We took each set of shears apart and put them back together multiple times to see how well the hinge worked. We also hand-washed each shear several times to see if there were any parts that were hard to scrub. Next, we cut up a cardboard box to see how sturdy they were. 


   What We Learned  
  Sharpness Didn’t Always Predict Performance  










Even sharp kitchen shears snagged and tore parchment paper.
Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Using a professional edge tester, we took a sharpness rating for every set of shears right out of the box—but the sharpest blades didn’t always excel during testing. While the J.A. Henckels Pull-Apart Kitchen Shears and Hammer Stahl Kitchen Shears were razor sharp (literally), they still struggled to neatly snip through the chives and snagged when sliding through the parchment paper.












Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



On the other hand, the Kershaw Taskmaster Shears was the dullest set we tested, yet still cut cleanly in every test. While the sharpness rating was a useful data point to collect, it wasn’t a clear indicator of performance. 


  Handle Comfort Was Key for Tough Cuts  










Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Wide, open handle loops were generally the most comfortable when cutting through bone because the handles didn’t dig into your knuckles. But there is such a thing as handle loops that are too wide. The loops on the Hammer Stahl shears were so open that our fingers shifted around as we applied more pressure, making it hard to get a firm grip. On the other hand, the OXO Good Grips Kitchen & Herb Scissors had narrower loops that pinched our fingers, even when snipping herbs. The most comfortable handles were on the Shun Multi-Purpose Kitchen Shears, the Kershaw Taskmaster Shears, and the Kai PRO Shears. The loops were the right size for larger and smaller hands, and they were made from a softer plastic that was comfortable to grip, even when we squeezed hard.

  Longer Blades Were Easier to Control  










There was a wide range of blade lengths in the kitchen shears we tested.
Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Shears with longer blades made straighter cuts due to extra surface area and a better fulcrum point for their hinge. Longer blades meant hinges were set closer to our hands, even the smallest thumb movement could open the blades wide enough to get around the bone. On the flip side, short-bladed shears, like the Wusthof Come Apart Shears, were awkward to use. They were hard to aim when trying to make small cuts, and we often had to open our hands uncomfortably wide in order to get the blades into position. 


  Well-Designed Hinges Were Easy to Put Back Together  










Tricky hinges (on the left) often looked exactly like smooth hinges (on the right).
Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



The best hinges created enough tension between both blades for snappy cutting action, and they also made it easy to slot the shears back together after cleaning. Time and time again the Shun shears would cut excellently, came apart quickly, and slotted back together like magic. Material’s The Good Shears, however, needed a lot of fiddling back and forth to reassemble (and the silicone rings often pop off and need to be reattached). It might feel like a small gripe, but it’s frustrating if you have to finagle to clean your shears after cutting chicken before you can open a package. 


  Micro-Serrations Were Grippy But Often Caused Tearing  










Micro-serrations (left) would often tear, while straight blades (right) made smooth cuts.
Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Many sets of kitchen shears had micro-serrations along the edge of one of the blades, but oftentimes these caused tearing—even on the sharpest scissors. The Kai Kitchen Scissors, OXO, and J.A. Henckels all snagged on the parchment paper, and all three also had difficulties cutting chives cleanly. Micro-serration is designed to grip while cutting, but if the teeth aren’t oriented well, they often just make a mess of things. The Shun, Kershaw, and Kai PRO shears all had two straight blades with serrations added to the outside of the blade instead of the interior cutting edge. This meant that even though the Kershaw’s edges were the dullest, it still could make clean and straight cuts without tearing. 


  Bonus Features Were Clutch—But Not a Dealbreaker  










Bonus features like a bone notch, bottle opener, nut cracker, and screwdriver tips were the icing on the cake of a good set of shears.
Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



Though we didn’t officially test bonus features (because not every set had the same ones), some did come in handy. The Shun, Kai Pro, and Kershaw shears all feature a nutcracker, jar opener, bone notch, and bottle opener, and two screwdriver tips that have proven useful in regular household applications outside of testing. However, sometimes you can go too far. Hammer Stahl’s addition of a fish scaler made them hard to clean, as the sponge would constantly snag—and let’s be honest, you’re much more likely to clean your shears than you are to use them to descale a fish.


   The Criteria: What to Look for in Kitchen Shears  










Serious Eats / Jesse Raub



The best kitchen shears can make precise, sharp cuts, and have longer blades for better control. They also have comfortable handles and responsive, easy-to-separate, and re-attach hinges. And if they had useful bonus features, that was certainly appreciated.

What we liked: These shears truly checked every box: comfortable, durable, and sharp out of the box. They cleanly sliced chives, effortlessly slid through parchment paper, and were still heavy-duty enough to cut through bone with ease. They held their edge even after cutting up cardboard boxes, showing almost no wear and tear. We particularly liked their blade design—instead of adding interior serration to the edge of the blade, notches were etched into the outside. This gave the shears a grip when cutting while avoiding any snagging or tearing. With long blades and a hinge closer to your hand, it was easy to make multiple cuts in a row with small hand movements. Lastly, they came apart easily and reassembled after cleaning without any hiccups. 



What we didn’t like: The only real downside of these shears is the price—though if you use kitchen shears as much as we do, we still think these are a bargain.

What we liked: While most shears with micro-serrations snagged and tore while cutting, these shears cut cleanly in every test. The non-serrated edge was as sharp as our winning set and didn’t show any signs of dulling at the end of testing. Their handle loops were comfortable to hold, and the pointy tips were great for making small, precise snips. Overall, they were a great set of shears—especially for their price point. 



What we didn’t like: Without a bone notch, it took more effort to spatchcock a chicken than we would have liked. They also didn't have as many additional features as our other winners, but the only one we really missed was the bone notch.

The Best Heavy-Duty Budget Shears


Kershaw Taskmaster Shears

What we liked: After selecting the Shun set as our winner, it’s easy to see why parent company Kai decided to make a few sets of clones. The main difference is that the Shun shears are made in Japan while this set from Kershaw (and the Kai PRO set) are made in China. There are also some minor differences in the depths of the serration and the shape of the blade points. And even though they weren’t rated very sharp by the edge tester, the straight blades of these Kershaw shears performed each test admirably, though they really shone when cutting up cardboard or snapping through bone. If you like the utility of the Shun set but see yourself tackling more heavy-duty projects, these Kershaw shears are affordable and up to the task. 



What we didn’t like: The duller blades on these shears couldn’t snip through chives as quickly as their sharper sibling, and the blunter tips weren’t as easy to maneuver for fine cutting work as the other two winners.

   The Competition  

Kai Kitchen Scissors: A previous Serious Eats pick, this pair didn’t fare as well in this round of testing. They snagged on the parchment paper slide and we had to muscle them through chicken bones. For the same price, we found both a sharper pair and a sturdier pair that we recommend instead. 
Kai PRO Shears: While these shears performed almost as well as our top pick (and look exactly like them), the Shun were considerably sharper and had pointier blades for just a slightly higher price, and the Kershaw are significantly cheaper if you’re looking for a budget pick. We do really like the Kai PRO shears, though, so they’re worth snagging if they ever go on sale. 
Kai Kitchen Scissors Offset: These shears were heavy, and while they cut paper well, they weren’t suited for snipping chives or spatchcocking chicken. 
J.A. Henckels Pull-Apart Kitchen Shears: Flimsy and with uncomfortable handles, these shears snagged on parchment and bruised chives. 
Material The Good Shears: While they were sharp, the Material shears were also pretty skimpy compared to the beefier competition. Their silicone handle coverings slipped off, too, causing the sharp steel edges to bite into our fingers and palms. 
Global Kitchen Shears: The all-steel handles on these shears were really rough on our knuckles, though they did cut fairly well. 
Hammer Stahl Kitchen Shears: The handle loops on these shears were too large and we couldn’t get a good grip when cutting. They also had a secondary angle on the main blade that acted like a bone notch, but it made crooked cuts. 
OXO Good Grips Kitchen & Herb Scissors: These shears pinched our fingers with narrow handle loops, and the blades snagged and tore instead of cutting cleanly. 
Wusthof Come Apart Shears: The shorter blade and awkward hinge position on these shears made it difficult to make straight cuts. They also had uncomfortable all-steel handles. 


   FAQs  
  What’s the difference between scissors and kitchen shears?  

Kitchen shears are designed for more heavy-duty tasks, like opening packaging or cutting through bone, and they’re usually duller than traditional scissors. They usually have bonus features for added utility, as well, like a bone notch, bottle opener, or screwdriver tip. Regular scissors have sharper blades and are usually designed to cut through paper or threads—more delicate tasks.


  What’s the difference between kitchen shears and poultry shears?  

While kitchen shears are designed to be a multi-use tool for opening packages, snipping herbs, and cutting paper, poultry shears usually have a spring-loaded hinge for extra force to cut through bone. Some sets of kitchen shears have a bone notch for small jobs (like spatchcocking a chicken), but for rib bones, or larger fowl (like a turkey), you’ll need a set of poultry shears. 


  Can kitchen shears cut meat?  

Yes—a good set of kitchen shears should be sharp enough to cut through meat easily. Most shears are also able to cut through chicken bones and are useful for spatchcocking. If you’re looking for precise cuts, however, a chef's knife is still your best bet. 


  What can you use kitchen shears for?  

A good set of kitchen shears can do just about anything—open packaging, snip herbs, cut through small bones, and more. Most sets also come with bonus features, like a bottle opener, screwdriver, jar opener, and nutcracker.


   Why We're the Experts  

For this review, we tested 12 pairs of kitchen shears, using them to snip chives, cut through paper, spatchcock chicken, and more. 
We last tested kitchen shears in 2018. Given the number of new shears on the market, we decided it was time to re-test them, but did include our previous top picks. Our overall favorite (from Shun) still came out on top this go around. That means our recommendation has held up to more than five years of evaluation.
