Why We're the Experts








Straight to the Point

Our overall favorite steak knives are the super sharp, well-made Victorinox 7.7240.4 Grand Maître Steak Knife Set. For a budget-friendly pick, we liked the Material The Table Knives.


In the grand scheme of kitchen gizmos and gadgets, a set of steak knives might seem, well, superfluous. Maybe you’re cutting back on eating red meat (or eating meat at all), or maybe you doubt the use case of buying a $$$ set of knives that will only see the light of day a few times a year. And while we agree that a set of steak knives is more of an indulgence than a necessity, I’ve also been in situations where I’m serving a grilled skirt steak with chimichurri for dinner and have to present guests with a motley crew of dull-ish paring knives to saw away at their meal with. This, at least, in my mind, is less than ideal. 



So, if you too like to serve steak in style (or just want a sharp set of knives for meat in general, as well as for cutting hardy vegetables), we took the metal to the meat (10.5 pounds of it, to be exact) to test 22 sets of steak knives ranging from $37 to $400, using previous testing to inform our lineup and testing protocols.

These knives sliced through every piece of meat with ease—there was no resistance. We also liked the curved, weighty wooden handle and the tang that ran the length of it.

This was a budget-friendly pick that punched above its weight class, slicing decidedly through tough skirt steak and tender filet mignon alike. We also liked the modern, minimalist look and that the set comes with a wooden steak knife holder for storage.

Our longtime favorite steak knives held up to their status as a solid set of knives; they had the heft and quality feel of knives three times the price, and a sharp blade that cut through steak with little resistance.

While we liked the look of the white handles and the classic steak knife shape, we loved that these knives cut through even tough skirt steak like it was flan, butter, etc, etc.

This modern set had a nice balance and weight, and the sharp blade had no issues cutting through meat. It also comes with a slick wooden black box for storing.

While the minimalist handles might not be everyone’s cup of tea, we were impressed with how sharp these knives were. If you just want a few knives to have in your back pocket for steak night, this set of two will do the trick.


   The Tests  










Serious Eats / Grace Kelly



Blade Sharpness Test: We used a professional blade edge tester to measure the out-of-the-box sharpness of each set of steak knives; we took three measurements and averaged the results. The lower the number, the sharper the knife. 
Skirt Steak Test: We had two people use a knife from each set to cut up a seared piece of skirt steak, noting if the knives cut the meat cleanly or tugged/mashed it. We also examined the handles and how they felt to hold. 
Filet Mignon Test (Winners-Only): We had two people use our winning knives to slice up quarter-pound filet mignon, noting if the knives sliced the tender meat cleanly. 
Cleaning Test: We hand-washed the knives, noting if they were easy to clean.


   What We Learned  
  Sharpness Readings Were Insightful, but Also Not Entirely Accurate  

A good steak knife should cut through tougher steak cuts with ease—that much is obvious. And while we were excited by some knives' out-of-the-box sharpness readings, sometimes the end results didn’t match up. For example, the Material Kitchen The Table Steak Knives didn’t have a fantastic out-of-the-box showing (they measured 135, which wasn't as sharp as other knives), but when pitted against skirt steak, they proved their mettle, slicing through the fibrous meat with ease. Conversely, the Consigli knives had razor-sharp readings when we used them on the professional blade edge tester (their average was 58.75, equal to a double-edged razor blade) but when cutting steak we felt small tugs of resistance. 


  Pricier Didn’t Necessarily Mean Better  










Serious Eats / Grace Kelly



Steak knives seem luxurious (maybe it’s the association with expensive cuts of steak), and as such, they can be outrageously expensive—take the Gucci of steak knives from Laguiole En Aubrac, which clock in at $400. And while some expensive knives lived up to their price tag (namely, the Victorinox 7.7240.4 Grand Maître Steak Knife Set, which was $347 and super sharp), others did not. The aforementioned Laguiole En Aubrac, for example, flunked the seared skirt steak test outright—they squished and mashed the steak, and only with significant effort could we cut a ragged slice. Even with the lowest sharpness score of the batch, we were still surprised at how badly they performed. On the other hand, the Material knives did quite well, cleanly slicing through skirt steak and filet mignon—and they’re only $90 for a set of four (that’s about $23 per knife, and the set also includes a wooden knife holder). While this isn’t dirt cheap, it was one of the less expensive sets we tested. 


  Serrations Shredded Steak  

Rather than grasp and cleanly slice, serrated steak knives shredded—it was a gruesome sight to behold indeed. This was especially evident with a stringy piece of meat like skirt steak, which the Amazon Basic Steak Knives and the HENCKELS Accent Forged Steak Knives absolutely eviscerated. Instead, we found non-serrated knives with smooth blades cut through steak much more readily and without destroying the muscle fibers; rather than tugging, sharp ones sliced straight through. This was in keeping with what we found in our previous tests, so we can assuredly say: avoid serrated steak knives at all costs! 


  Handles Made a Difference  

In our tests, we preferred handles that had a more old-world feel; that is, they had a bit of curve to them and a bit more heft and bulk, guiding our hand downward as we sliced (like the Messermeister, Zwilling, and Victorinox Grand Maitre knives). It was a plus when the tang ran through the length of the handle, promoting longevity. That said, we did have a few top picks that had skimpier, thinner, and lightweight handles, like the Victorinox Swiss Modern and Material knives; while the thinner handles weren’t our favorites, they made up for it with super sharp blades.


   The Criteria: What to Look for in a Steak Knife Set  










Serious Eats / Grace Kelly



The biggest takeaway when buying a set of steak knives is to avoid serrations—they tug and shred—and invest in straight-edged knives, which slice cleanly through steak. Next, don’t be bamboozled by lofty price tags—just because a set of knives costs the same as a cheap flight to Europe doesn’t mean they’re guaranteed to be great. Two of the most expensive knives we tested, from Laguiole En Aubrac and Consigli, weren’t the best when used “in the field,” so to speak. Finally, seek out sharp knives with sturdy handles; we preferred full-tang, hefty handles that helped guide our hands as they cut down through the steak. That said, we did like some more modern, minimalist-style knives, they just have a different hand feel.

What we liked: Well-built, sturdy, and sharp, this is the set of steak knives for the steak aficionado (you know, the person who converted a mini fridge to dry-age Tomahawks). They cut through tough skirt steak so easily, it was hard to believe it was a, well, skirt steak. 



What we didn’t like: The worst part about this set of knives is the price tag—at $347 for a set of four, that’s nearly $87 a knife, which is undeniably a lot.

What we liked: This knife set impressed us with their razor-sharp blades (my husband, one of the lucky testers, actually exclaimed “wow, this is nuts!” as he cut slice after slice). The knives also smoothly sliced filet mignon without mashing it. We liked that the set came with a wooden box for storing the knives upright. 



What we didn’t like: The handles were the biggest complaint we had about these knives; while very pretty (and available in various colors), they were a little on the thin side and didn’t have the same heft as more traditional steak knives.

What we liked: Our longtime winners impressed us once more, with decently sharp blades, elegant, old-school handles (with full tangs), and a super budget-friendly price tag. 



What we didn’t like: They were a tad less sharp than some of the other knives we tested, tugging ever so slightly at grainy skirt steak and finding some resistance cutting through the thick-crusted sear on a filet mignon.

The Best Mid-Priced Steak Knives


ZWILLING Pro Le Blanc Steak Knives, Set of 4














Food52

$250







What we liked: These are some gorgeous, gorgeous knives. But beyond the classy aesthetic, these knives actually performed extremely well, slicing through tough and tender steak alike. We liked the old-school handle, which was just the right weight. 



What we didn’t like: Our only qualm was with the heel (which is located under the knife near the handle), which stuck out a bit too much; sometimes we hit it on the plate when we went to cut another slice. Oh, and the hefty price tag (around $63 per knife).

What we liked: This elegant, modern set featured four knives with beautiful olive wood handles and super sharp blades. They had a nice heft to them and cut through steak readily. Plus, they come with a sleek wooden black box for storage, which is nice. 



What we didn’t like: One thing we didn’t love about this set was that it was hard to tell which side was the cutting side—the tops and bottoms looked identical. More than once we sawed away at steak, only to find we were using the dull top of the blade! They’re also on the pricey side at $249 for a set of four.

What we liked: This set of two modern, minimalist-looking knives was ultra-sharp; cutting through a seared skirt steak never felt easier. If you’re a family of two (or one) and don’t want a bunch of knives jangling around in your drawer, this could be a good pick.



What we didn’t like: At $99 for two knives, this is one pricey, tiny set. While we didn’t mind the lightweight, sleek handles, others may find them rather small and thin.

   The Competition  

Laguiole En Aubrac Olivewood Steak Knives: These knives have quite the reputation (fancy, beautiful, AND expensive), but even though we ensured we received the real deal knives (there are a lot of knockoffs out there), we were pretty disappointed. Not only were they dull out of the box, but they were also completely ineffective at cutting steak, slipping and sliding over the seared parts, and mashing the interior.
Amazon Basics 8-Piece Kitchen Steak Knife Set: We thought, maybe a cheap knife from Amazon could upend the lineup and be a winner? Nope—not when they had serrations that literally tore steak to shreds. 
HENCKELS Accent Forged Steak Knives: Another serrated set that shredded rather than sliced. 
Victorinox Wood Steak Knife Set, 2 pieces in Modified Maple - 5.1200.12G: While these knives weren’t terrible, they just weren’t as sharp as our winners. 
Consigli for Food52 Handcrafted Italian Steak Knives, set of 6: The tortoise-shell lucite handles were gorgeous to look at but slippery to hold, and the blades just weren’t as sharp as our top picks. 
Chicago Cutlery B144 4pc Walnut Tradition Steak Knife Set: With a blade that curves upward, we weren’t able to get as much traction with each swipe—plus, the blades were rather dull. 
Opinel Olive Wood Steak Knives, Set of 4: This lightweight set felt a bit flimsy, and the blades, while somewhat sharp, weren’t at the same level as our top picks. 
Misen Steak Knives: If you're set on getting serrated steak knives (we advise against it), you might be happy with these. While their boxy, rectangular handles gave off attractive retro vibes, it took a considerable amount of “sawing” to slice through steak with one of these knives. Their magnetized cardboard storage box was a decent touch, but fussy to open.
Messermeister Oliva Elité 4 Piece Fine Edge Steak Knife Set: This is one of the company's high-end steak knives, but we actually preferred the performance and look of the much more affordable Avanta model.
WÜSTHOF Classic Ikon Precision Forged Steak Knife Set: These looked too much like kitchen boning knives, and we were disappointed by their out-of-the-box sharpness. 
WÜSTHOF Gourmet Six-Piece Kitchen Steak Knife Set: A more modestly priced model from the German knife giant, the WÜSTHOF Gourmet was panned for its looks (we especially disliked the bright red logo on the handle) and its cutting performance was mediocre.
Laguiole Jean Dubost Knife Set: These knives felt cheap with rivets that didn't sit flush against the handle of the knife. We also hated the semi-serrated edge of these knives.
UMOGI Stainless Steel Steak Knives: These knives cut well but were sidelined for their metal handle, which was less attractive (and harder to grip) than the competition. 
Dalstrong Steak Knives: This set costs twice as much as the Messermeister Avanta with similar performance. 
Shun Classic Steak Knives: While they were extremely sharp out of the box and featured a beautiful Damascus steel pattern, these knives were just too pricey to recommend when our top pick matched their performance. 
Global Classic Steak Knives - Set of 4: With a small handle, tiny serrations, and a short blade, these steak knives from Global didn’t make the cut.
Percival The 9.47 Table Knife: While we liked this set of two knives in our previous testing, we think $275 for two knives is rather steep (which comes out to $137 per knife), considering you can get a similar set of four steak knives from Made In for around that price.


   FAQs  
  Are steak knives worth it?  

If you're eating meat (steak, pork chops, even chicken) regularly, we do think it's worth investing in a steak knife set. Steak knives both cut and look beautiful, adding precision and a little welcome flair to any dinner table. Plus, their use goes beyond steak—we've been known to use them to tuck into a slab of cauliflower or wedge of roasted cabbage.


  Can you use steak knives for other things?  

Steak knives are useful for so much more than just beef. These sharp-edged tools are efficient at slicing through any cooked protein, and even hearty roasted vegetables, like winter squash and broccoli.


  Does the handle matter on steak knives?  

To a certain degree, yes. Although the handle may not be as immediately important as the blade, it will make or break your experience using the knife. Ideally, steak knives should have well-balanced handles that are easy to grip, and feel comfortable in your hand. The material used is largely up to personal preference, although the price will vary depending on the material (polymer handles, for example, will be less expensive than Laguiole-style horn or antler handles). We also like handles that have a tang running their full length, which lessens the chance of the blade falling out after years of wear and tear.


  Does the type of metal matter for steak knives?  

You’ll often see steak knives (as well as other knives) advertised as being made with different types of steel, such as German or Japanese. This is partially a personal preference, but it really all comes down to the edge. An ultra-thin edge will (hopefully) come out of the box razor sharp, but it will require more frequent sharpening. Conversely, a slightly chunkier edge may not slice through your shoe, but it won’t need constant babysitting.


  Do steak knives get dull?  

Yes; like all kitchen knives, steak knives lose their edge with use and time.


  Can you sharpen steak knives?  

You sure can! Steak knives with smooth blades are easier to sharpen than serrated steak knives, but both can be whipped back into shape. You can use a whetstone, or follow the directions on an electric sharpener. Of course, you can always have your knives professionally sharpened. Do so when you notice more pressure or leverage is needed to achieve smooth cuts. 


  Can you put steak knives in the dishwasher?  

In the interest of keeping a sharp edge on your blades for as long as possible, we recommend hand-washing steak knives and drying them immediately. You shouldn't put steak knives (or anything with a blade, including kitchen shears) in the dishwasher. Plus, some steak knives have wooden handles and wood should never go in the dishwasher (it will emerge looking parched and damaged and could even crack).


  How do you store steak knives?  

Steak knives, like all other sharp knives, should be kept safe from being jostled around or knocked into by other utensils. You can use a sheath or knife roll; if you’ve got the room on your magnetic knife strip, that’s an excellent idea, too. Some of the knives we tested came with permanent storage solutions, while others will require an additional purchase. The important thing is to avoid tossing them loose in a utensil drawer.


  Should steak knives be serrated?  

We did not like serrated knives, which tore at steak rather than cleanly slicing it. Plus, straight-edged knives are easier to sharpen and maintain. 


  How much should you spend on steak knives?  

We found great steak knives ranging from $50 to $347, so it really depends on you, your budget, and if you use steak knives quite a bit. Quality, durable knives do seem to end up on the higher end of the pricing spectrum, so that's something to keep in mind.


   Why We're the Experts  

Grace Kelly is the associate commerce editor at Serious Eats. 
Prior to this, she tested equipment and ingredients for America’s Test Kitchen. She's worked as a journalist and has done stints as a cook and bartender. 
She has written dozens of reviews for Serious Eats, including petty knives, tinned fish, fish spatulas, and tortilla presses, among others. 
For this updated review, we cut up a little over nine pounds of skirt steak and one pound of filet mignon. We had two users evaluate knives based on sharpness and how they felt to hold and use. 
We first tested steak knives four years ago by cutting up lots of skirt steak. For this most recent review, we re-tested our previous top picks and kept the knives we didn’t like in The Competition section.
