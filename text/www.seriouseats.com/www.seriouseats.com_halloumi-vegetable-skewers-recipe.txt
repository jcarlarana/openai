Living in a predominantly Greek neighborhood for over ten years now, I'm well versed in the awesomeness of halloumi—a salty and squeaky semi-soft cheese that transforms into one of the most delicious things on the planet after being pan-fried or grilled. Hailing from Cyprus, it's usually made of goat or sheep's milk. The cheese is so ingrained in my life at this point that I often forget that many people have never heard of, let alone tried, this wonder before.



I recently cubed a couple blocks of halloumi and threaded them onto skewers with onions, zucchini, and tomatoes that were tossed in a Greek-influenced vinaigrette of oil, red wine vinegar, garlic, oregano, and mint. I grilled these up at a barbecue, and for the uninitiated, it was nothing short of a revelation.



I meant for these skewers to be served with warm pita and tzatziki to be made into instant sandwiches, but instead I watched the golden crusty cheese get picked clean from the skewers, leaving the vegetables sadly passed up. Consider that fair warning—this veggie and cheese combo works great as cohesive skewer, but the all-encompassing power of halloumi will certainly steal the show.
