Why It Works

Butter moderates and carries the briny saltiness of the anchovy.Cayenne, cinnamon, white pepper, and nutmeg add piquancy.


This classic condiment is a type of seasoned anchovy butter that is also known as Patum Peperium. The strong anchovy flavor is complemented by cayenne pepper and ground nutmeg, and fresh lemon juice cuts through both the butter and the anchovy to add just a little lightness to this intense compound butter. It may not be the prettiest thing that has ever come out of your kitchen, but as a quick snack on toast with sliced cucumbers, or an interesting condiment for baked potatoes, this humble butter will surely work its way into many of your favorite dishes.



One of my favorite things about this relish is how many different ways you can use it. For those of us who love anchovies, a simple tea sandwich made with this relish and watercress is heaven with some tea. But for those who aren't big fans of the hairy little fish, it still makes a great tool in your culinary arsenal. Using this to top a perfect grilled steak, or to sauté a few potatoes, adds that little bit of extra flavor that can elevate a simple dish into something to serve to your guests.



Making this relish is as simple as turning on your food processor, but if you don't have one, you can make it just as easily with a wooden spoon, a big bowl, and a few minutes.

   Ingredients   




8 ounces (2 sticks) butter, room temperature


8 ounces (4 tins) flat anchovies, drained


1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon


1/4 teaspoon white pepper


1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper


Dash of fresh grated nutmeg


2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste


Kosher salt and cracked black pepper, to taste















Directions





Combine butter, anchovies, cinnamon, white pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice in a food processor and pulse until well combined. Taste for seasoning and add additional salt, pepper, and lemon juice if necessary. Alternatively, mash butter with a wooden spoon in a large bowl and then finely chop the anchovies. Add anchovies, cinnamon, white pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice to the bowl, and mix to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and mix again.











Serious Eats / Sydney Oland






Use right away as a spread on toast with sliced cucumber or watercress, or use as an additional ingredient to a cottage pie or scrambled eggs, or as a salty condiment for a baked potato, and even as a topping for a seared steak.
