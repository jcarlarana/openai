Flap meat, also known as sirloin tip, is one of the most tender and flavorful cuts for your dollar. The key is to use a great spice rub for flavor and to slice thinly against the grain for tenderness.

   Ingredients   




1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, toasted


1 teaspoon coriander seed, toasted


1 teaspoon fennel seed, toasted


1 teaspoon cumin pods, toasted


1 teaspoon red pepper flakes


1/2 teaspoon dried oregano


2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)


2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil


1 whole flap meat steak, 2 to 2 1/2 pounds


Kosher salt















Directions





Combine pepper, coriander, fennel, cumin, red pepper flakes, and oregano in a mortar and pestle and grind until coarsely crushed. Alternatively pulse in a spice grinder or food processor until coarsely crushed (not powdered). Transfer to a small bowl. Add garlic and oil and mix with a fork to combine. Rub spice paste over all surfaces of meat, massaging it to work mixture into crevices.





Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.





Season steak liberally with salt. Place over hot side of grill and cook, turning frequently, until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 125°F and a charred crust has formed on the surface (if threatening to burn, cook over middle of grill or over cool side of grill as necessary), about 8 to 10 minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and tent with foil. Let rest for 5 minutes.





Cut steak into quarters cross-wise (with the grain), then rotate each quarter by 90°F and slice thinly against the grain. Serve immediately.
